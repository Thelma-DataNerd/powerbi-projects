### Overview
This repository is a collection of my Power BI dashboards and reports built to analyze and visualize data across different domains. Each project demonstrates my skills in data transformation, and ranges from basic to advanced analysis using e.g DAX calculations, interactive visuals, and storytelling with data.
- Tools : Power BI - Power Query Editor, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Relationships and Data Modeling, Data Visualization.

### Water Survey Project
- Objectives: This project aims to analyze water access, identify regions with insufficient water infrastructure to prioritize development, highlights water contamination levels for targeted intervention, and analyze both queue times and gender disparities to improve accessibility and efficiency.
- Outcome:
   * Most common water sources are wells, shared taps and home taps.
   * Some regions still rely on river water, indicating infrastructure gaps.
   * 63.85% of the rural population faces graeter water accessibility challenges.
   * 40.8% of wells are chemically contaminated, requiring urgent attention.
   * $147M total budget was allocated across the 5 provinces.
   * Highest funded provinces are Sokoto ($40.15M) and Kilimani ($39.25M).

### Water Infrastructure Budget Tracker
- Objectivies: To allocate budget across multiple regions affected by water availability crises.
- Outcome:
   * A total of $125.86M has been spent, and this has exceeded the budget goal of $120.1M by 4.79%. Therefore monitoring cost overruns is essential to maintain financial sustainability.
