### Overview
This repository is a collection of my Power BI dashboards and reports built to analyze and visualize data across different domains. Each project demonstrates my skills in data transformation, and ranges from basic to advanced analysis using e.g DAX calculations, interactive visuals, and storytelling with data.
- Tools : Power BI - Power Query Editor, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Relationships and Data Modeling, Data Visualization.

### Water Survey Analysis

- In this project I leveraged Power BI to analyze how clean water access is improving across 5 provinces. It highlights the no. of people served, types of water sources used, and where resources are being invested. With clear visuals and key metrics, it offers a snapshot of progress and areas that still needs attention.

- Outcome:
   * Most common water sources are wells, shared taps and home taps.
   * Some regions still rely on river water, indicating infrastructure gaps.
   * 63.85% of the rural population faces graeter water accessibility challenges.
   * 40.8% of wells are chemically contaminated, requiring urgent attention.
   * $147M total budget was allocated across the 5 provinces.
   * Highest funded provinces are Sokoto ($40.15M) and Kilimani ($39.25M).

### Water Infrastructure Budget Tracker

- The Water Infrastructure Budget Tracker project monitors the progress, spending, and impact of ongoing efforts to expand access to clean and safe water across multiple provinces. The initiative aims to improve basic water access, targeting underserved regions, and is set to run from December 31, 2022, to April 30, 2026. The dashboard provides real-time insights into budget utilization, project completion status, infrastructure deployment, and the number of citizens positively impacted. By visualizing cost breakdowns and tracking performance metrics, the project supports data-driven decision-making to ensure efficient resource allocation and maximize impact.

- Outcome:
   * A total of $91.6M has been spent, and this has exceeded the budget goal of $86.95M by 5.4%. Therefore monitoring cost overruns is essential to maintain financial sustainability.
